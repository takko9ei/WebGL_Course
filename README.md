# WebGL_Course

this is course works of Advancecd CG, Waseda University, FSE

## HWO

hw0 asks using `canvas`, draw a house, with roof, wall, windows, and door. I implemented it just using `moveTo()` and `lineTo`, and `drawRect()` stuffs. (refer to <https://github.com/takko9ei/WebGL_Course/blob/main/HW0/house.html>)

## HW1

Goal: Use WebGL to render:

A dot with exponential decay.

A moving rectangle (using Signed Distance Functions/SDF).

A letter (using SDF).

Note: Only files prefixed with assignment are the actual submissions. Other files (excluding Assignments 0, 1, and 2) are for WebGL practice and serve as a boilerplate for future tasks.

## HW2

Goal: Render a rotating octahedron.

## HW3

Goal: Render a fish using a single fragment shader (Shadertoy style).

Files: Please check the assignment folder. It contains two files (a .glsl file and a browser-compatible .html file) that produce identical renderings.
