# WebGL_Course

this is course works of Advancecd CG, Waseda University, FSE

## HWO

hw0 asks using `canvas`, draw a house, with roof, wall, windows, and door. I implemented it just using `moveTo()` and `lineTo`, and `drawRect()` stuffs. (refer to <https://github.com/takko9ei/WebGL_Course/blob/main/HW0/house.html>)

also, i finished an advanced version, using my own helper tool, drawing a American Football album cover. (refer to <https://github.com/takko9ei/WebGL_Course/blob/main/HW0/house(af).html>)

## HW1

this hw asks to draw tomething using webgl.

i took several files, to get familiar with webgl 2.0, especially vao, vbo stuffs, because i only have unity shaderlab, shadergraph, bender shader nodes stuffs experience before.

test, test1, test2, given_skeleton, these files are test. please ignore them.

for real hw proj, refer to assignment1, 2, 3. :3
